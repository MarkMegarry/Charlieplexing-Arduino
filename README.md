# Charlieplexing-Arduino
Arduino code used to test a 4-pin, 12-LED charlieplex matrix

Currently running on an ATTiny85, but could be used on an Arduino-compatible board **so long as the definitions at the top of the source code are configrued**
# WARNING
**This code has not been extensively tested and is to be considered unfinished**

**Incorrectly wiring LEDs used with this code may damage or destroy them. Check the forward voltage drop and maximum reverse voltage of your components before using this code**

**I assume no responsibility for damage or destruction caused by the use of this code**
